### Overview

This Hack Reactor front-end capstone project is a single-page shopping website simulation of an e-commerce website. Users will be able to interact with the UI and view products for sale. Feature highlights include adding user questions, viewing related product items, and accessing prdouct information such as product details and photos using a restful API.

Given a wireframe design, our group of three software engineering students had to develop a front-end project reflecting the design and following a list of features requirements.

### Description

Our application allows the user to click through products and styles to add to their shopping carts. They can view related product items to the selected item in order to make comparisons and/or select the item to add it to the main viewer. In addition, users can see the current questions asked for the selected product as well as add their own questions & answers. Overall, there is a click tracker that logs the usersâ€™ click interactions into an API.

### Set Up

Our application uses React, Express, Axios, webpack, and babel. To set up and run the application we must first install the required npm packages and then run the npm commands to start webpack and the server. We would also need our own .env file for autorization access.

1) In the project's root directory install the required packages by running the following command in your terminal:
```
npm install
```
2) Run the following command to start the server:
```
npm run start
```
3) In a separate terminal, run webpack.
```
npm run dev-server
```

4) Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and use GitHub personal access token for API_Key.

5) Open the project in your web browser.
http://localhost:8080
